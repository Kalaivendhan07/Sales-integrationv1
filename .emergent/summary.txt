The AI engineer's work began with setting up a PHP 8.2/MariaDB environment, debugging installation issues, and running initial database schema creation. After confirming the basic setup, the focus shifted to rigorous testing and bug fixing of complex business logic. This involved resolving numerous database schema mismatches (e.g.,  column,  vs. ), PHP 8.2 compatibility issues in SQL bindings, and logic errors in the . A significant portion of the work involved iteratively refining core features: stage transition logic was expanded to cover all 12 defined stages, up-sell/cross-sell distinctions were clarified and correctly implemented, and the crucial multi-product opportunity splitting logic was added and extensively debugged to ensure precise volume, stage, and potential adjustments without conflicting with other validation levels. Performance testing for daily batch processing was also implemented, leading to the creation of . The AI consistently used scenario-based testing to validate fixes, incorporating user feedback to address subtle business rule nuances, such as ensuring retention leads remain unchanged during cross-sell. The latest interaction involves tackling a complex scenario combining retention and multi-product opportunities.

The goal is to build a Pipeline Manager India Sales integration system in PHP 8.2/MySQL, replacing an old React/FastAPI stack. It processes sales data (CSV/Excel) to automatically create/update opportunities. Key features include a DSM action queue, a 120-day audit trail, and rollback capabilities. Core business rules mandate specific identifiers for integration-managed leads, protection against their deletion, and system-only Order stage transitions. Multi-product opportunities require splitting: a new opportunity for the matched product ( stage,  type) and the original updated with reduced potential. Sales returns either move to  (full return) or stay  (partial). Enhancements include SKU-level tracking, tier-based Up-Sell detection (Mainstream to Premium), DSR reassignment for Call Plans, and volume discrepancy tracking. All 12 opportunity stages (Suspect, Prospect, Approach, Negotiate, Close, Order, Payment, Lost, Sleep, Retention, Pending, Reject) must transition to  upon sales, except 'Retention' which requires special cross-sell/up-sell checks.

The application, rebuilt from React/FastAPI to PHP 8.2 and MariaDB, follows this structure:



**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Manages PDO MySQL connection.
- , : Define the core and enhancement database schema.  and  tables were added.
- : Central to the application. Heavily modified to implement 6-level validation, SKU-level tracking, Up-Sell/Cross-Sell logic, multi-product splitting, and comprehensive stage transition rules. Extensive fixes for  to , and handling of  flag.
- : Handles sales return logic, fixed for schema mismatches.
- : Logs system actions, involved in various fixes for correct logging parameters.
- : Main test suite, constantly updated and debugged for PHP 8.2 compatibility, trigger handling, and various logic validation issues.
- : Used for focused backend component testing and debugging, particularly for GSTIN validation and core engine issues.
- : Newly created for production-ready batch processing of sales records.
- : Continuously updated with test outcomes and progress.
- Numerous scenario-specific test files (e.g., , , ): Created iteratively for debugging and verifying specific business logic flows.
- Database triggers (e.g., ): Implemented at the database level for robust rule enforcement.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a complex scenario provided by the user: a sales entry (600L Tellus, GSTIN 11AAGCA2111H1ZD, DSR 1) for an existing multi-product opportunity in the 'Retention' stage (Rimula, Tellus, Gadus products, DSR 1, 500L volume). This scenario tests the intricate interaction between Retention logic and Multi-Product Splitting logic. The AI previously fixed a bug where, during a cross-sell from a Retention lead, the original Retention lead's volume was incorrectly updated; this was corrected to ensure the original lead remains untouched. For the current scenario, the AI has just created a new test file, , to simulate this specific situation and verify the system's behavior. The expectation is to correctly handle the existing 'Retention' lead and potentially create new opportunities or update existing ones based on the 'Tellus' product sale, considering the multi-product nature of the original opportunity and the current 'Retention' stage.
